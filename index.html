   <p><b>1. VEHICLE LIFT</b></p>
    <p>Every mechanic needs to get under the vehicles to perform essential inspections and diagnostics. Your shop will need lifts to raise the vehicle to the height needed for these services.
    
    Match your needs to the various models and capacities of lift models. There are many characteristics that you need to consider. Including safety features, 2-post vs. 4-post construction, accessories, and power requirements.
    
    Be sure to buy lifts that are of high quality and name brand, to ensure availability of parts and service. Lifts are an important investment for your repair shop, as they're built to last many years.</p>

   <p> Price:120$</p>

   <p><b>2. Air Compressor</b></p>
   <p>You will need a reliable air compressor to operate many tools within your shop, including pneumatic hand tools and some auto lifts. Get the highest capacity you can afford, to be sure you have the power you need for powering the needs of your shop – a good example would be a 60 or 120-gallon compressor.</p>
   <img src="m1.jpg" width="400" height="300">
   <p> Price 90$</p>
    
   <p><b>3. Jack, jack stands, and pole jacks</b></p>
   <p>Many auto repairs will require raising vehicles at least temporarily. So a strong floor jack will be utilized on a regular basis. Get a high-quality, high-capacity jack, and strong jack stands to support the vehicle once they're elevated. Pole jacks will also be useful to support axles or other components of raised vehicles.</p>
   <img src="m2.jpg" width="400" height="300">
<p>Price 50$</p>

<p><b>4. Oil drain and oil caddy</b></p>
<p>Services like changing oil and transmission fluid will need an oil caddy with enough capacity to contain the largest fluid volume. As your services expand and you’re working with vehicles on lifts. A standing oil caddy that can reach the raised vehicle will make the job easier and quicker.</p>
<img src="m6.jpg" width="400" height="300">
<p>Price 50$</p>

<p><b>5. Battery charger and jumper</b></p>
<p>You know this better than we do but many jobs will pertain to dead batteries or charging problems. Your shop will need a good battery charger and jumper to handle these services. You don't need to break the bank but considering that you'll get a lot of these cases, it's pivotal to showcase your best equipment to your customers. </p>

    <p>Rohan James Mondragon, CEO of RJ autoshops comes from a long line of entrepreneurs and auto enthusiasts. His parents owned an auto dealership and tire distribution business since before he was born igniting a passion for cars in Rj's life that would last a lifetime.
    
        In early 2006,Rohan James Mondragon  founded  RJ autoshops, an automotive equipment distribution center, with him as the lead salesman in the NYC region. He named it Rj, the three initials of his children, Juan, Maggie and Connie. So of course, he wanted the business to represent family, and his drive was leaving a legacy for his children once the business was successful.
        
        He dominated the area and quickly became known as one of the most knowledgeable equipment salespersons in the region. However, Rj. noticed that as good as his father was, he could only visit a handful of clients per day. So, he gave his father the idea to launch an ecommerce website where he can reach thousands of people a day. In 2011, Rj. launched the great website that we know, Rj autoshops It went from having a handful of products when it was first launched to over 10,000 products today.
        
        The dynamic duo of father and son worked hard everyday and little by little JMC became the powerhouse we know today. Of course, just like in every other company, they had their ups and downs but through their determination and passion for the industry they were able to overcome and build a great legacy for their family. Today, they are leaders in the automotive industry and their goal is to help inspire and encourage every repair and auto body shop reach their full potential as a business.
        
        Our Philosophy
        As customers first and Automotive Equipment Distributors second, we know how important it is to feel 100% sure about any purchase. This is why we strongly believe in helping customers become as knowledgeable as we are and encourage them to ask as many questions possible to ensure satisfaction with every purchase.
